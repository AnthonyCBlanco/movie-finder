# movie-finder

## Description

We love movies. Our friends love movies. You love movies. We wanted to create an application that allows users to search for and find their favorite movies and find information about them. Do you have a favorite director? Are you a fan of a particular production company or are you a fan of a particular actor? Movie Finder is for you. For the true cinephiles, Movie Finder offers a dedicated place for you to keep track of the films you watch and get recommendations on what to watch next.

We learned the importance of practicing AGILE development and how to integrate multiple APIs into one cohesive application. Utilizing information from multiple APIs allows for new functionality that can be applied in ways previously unthought of. We also learned how to create a project by collaborating with others.

## Installation

Not applicable. Movie Finder can be accessed on any desktop or mobile browser.

## Usage

Finding a film has never been easier using the dedicated search field. Upon entering your query takes you to a page with results. Pick your film from the list and you will be directed to a page with the poster art, a detailed synopsis, cast and crew information, and much more. At the bottom will be a trailer for you to preview your selection. Or if you want to search for something else, click the button at the top of the page and enter your title in the search field. Click the button and it will populate titles based on your search criteria.
